              At IICS, leadership is rooted in collaboration, creativity, and
              impact. We believe the best institutions are led by those who have
              lived the industry — and are now committed to transforming it
              through education. From the boardroom to the classroom, our
              leaders are hands-on, future-focused, and driven to build India’s
              creative capital.
